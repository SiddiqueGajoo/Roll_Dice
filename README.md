# My First Flutter Dice Roll App

 This is my first Flutter app! It's a simple dice rolling game. When you tap the "Roll Dice" button, two random numbers are generated, and the app displays the corresponding dice images.

What I Learned:

- Flutter Basics: I learned about the basics of Flutter, like how to build layouts with widgets and manage the state of the app.
- Widgets: I used different widgets to create the user interface, including buttons and image displays.
- Random Number Generation: I figured out how to use Dart's dart:math library to generate random numbers for the dice.
- Variables: Dart Variables and Value types, Const & Final Variables
- Custom Widgets: I created reusable custom widgets to make my code more organized.
- Gradient: Also Add Gradient as a screen color,Also about Genrics,Lists
- Classes: I learn also about Dart Classes and work with constructor Functions, Named & Positional Arguments
